# 🐮 Cows and Bulls

A Python implementation of the classic word/number guessing game: **Cows and Bulls**!

---

## 🎯 Game Description

Cows and Bulls is an interactive code-breaking game for one player:

- The computer picks a random (3-digit) number (with all digits different).
- The player tries to guess the number.
- For every guess, the computer responds with:
  - 🐮 **Cows**: Number of digits guessed correctly — but in the **wrong position**.
  - 🐂 **Bulls**: Number of digits guessed correctly — and in the **correct position**.
- The player continues guessing until the correct number is found!
